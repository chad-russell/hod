# AGENTS.md - Hod

This file is the **agent/LLM quick-start**. `README.md` is human-oriented; this file is optimized for fast, accurate repo entry.

## Read order

1. `README.md`
2. `docs/README.md`
3. the relevant Rust/TS modules for your task
4. `plans/README.md` only after you know whether a plan is active or historical

## Ground truth

- **TypeScript recipes are the source of truth.** Authoritative recipes live in `recipes/**/*.ts`.
- **Hod is not source-only.** Prefer upstream release binaries when that is the pragmatic supported path, as long as artifacts are content-hashed and made self-contained in the Hod store (host may provide the Linux kernel, not userland libraries/interpreters).
- **`.hod` files are not the normal workflow.** They are for import/export/debugging.
- **There is no top-level `PRD.md`.** Do not add new references to it.
- **Current behavior lives in `docs/`, source, and tests.** `plans/` contains design history and active planning notes, but many files there are historical.
- **Some ignored tests and old notes still mention historical checked-in `.hod` recipes.** Treat those as historical unless you confirm the current code path still uses them.

## Key current behavior

- `hod run` and `hod shell` accept either a **64-char recipe hash** or a **path to a `.ts` recipe file**.
- `hod profile activate/build` are implemented.
- Profile env scripts set **`PATH`**, **`MANPATH`**, and **`XDG_DATA_DIRS`**; they intentionally do **not** set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
- `hod closure` and `hod copy-closure` are implemented; `copy-closure --from` is not.
- Process `runtime_deps` drive:
  - store-relative ELF relocation
  - AT_EXECFN bootstrap injection for executables
  - post-build wrapper generation for runtime env like `XDG_DATA_DIRS` / `GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_PATH` / `GSK_RENDERER` / `GIO_LAUNCH_DESKTOP`
- Core Rust no longer injects C/C++-specific build env automatically. Ecosystem env composition lives in TS helpers like `cProfile`, `cargoBuild`, and `goBuild`.
- `shellBuild` injects the long dummy RPATH automatically. If a recipe overrides linker flags manually, it must preserve the dummy RPATH slot.

## Debugging philosophy

When a user reports a runtime failure, always:

1. **Identify the root cause** — trace the error back to the actual missing piece (a disabled build option, a missing runtime_dep, a wrong path, etc.).
2. **Provide a quick workaround** — give the user a one-liner that works *now* (e.g. `GDK_BACKEND=x11`).
3. **Suggest the proper fix** — propose the recipe or infrastructure change that eliminates the root cause for good.

Never stop at "it works on my machine" or "try a different binary." The goal is to close the gap permanently.

## When editing docs

- Keep `README.md` human-oriented.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` agent-oriented.
- Keep `docs/README.md` as the authoritative docs index.
- Keep `plans/README.md` as the status index for plans.
- Mark plan files clearly as **active**, **implemented**, **superseded**, or **historical**.
- Separate **implemented now** from **future design**.
- Remove broken links and stale references when you find them.

## Validation

Use the Nix dev shell if tools are missing:

```bash
nix develop --accept-flake-config
```

Good default checks:

```bash
nix develop --accept-flake-config --command cargo test --no-run
nix develop --accept-flake-config --command cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```

Avoid ignored bootstrap/sandbox tests unless explicitly asked.

## Recent milestone

The current tree has crossed an important portability milestone:

- build **Nautilus 48.7** from source
- copy its closure to another machine (NixOS + niri)
- run it there — window rendering, schema resolution, and "Open With" app launching all work

This means closure transfer + relocation + wrapper/runtime setup are now good enough for a complex GTK4/libadwaita GUI app with a deep dependency tree.

Additionally, the COSMIC desktop environment build is complete:

- **All 19** COSMIC components build from source (8 core + 10 supporting + pop-launcher + cosmic-icons + xdg-desktop-portal-cosmic)
- Full dependency chain: Mesa → eudev/libinput/seatd → PulseAudio/pipewire → cosmic-comp → all apps
- xdg-desktop-portal-cosmic was unblocked by source-built bindgen infrastructure (LLVM 18/Clang built from source, cmake built from source)
- Ready to proceed to Phase 5 (bootable VM image) with all 19 components

## Likely next fronts

1. enable Vulkan/GL in GTK4 build to eliminate `GSK_RENDERER=cairo` workaround
2. improve multi-machine / binary-cache workflows (`copy-closure --from`, pull flows)
